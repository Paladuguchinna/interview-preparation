## Java Concepts

1. Basics of OOP            - Class, Object, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

2. Program with Condition 	- if, else, if-else, switch

3. Exception Handling       - try-catch-finally & throw, throws. Example for Checked & Unchecked Exception

4. Program with Iteration 	- Using single for loop & two for loops
                            - while (with reminder programs)

5. Program with collection 	- Creating a list, set, map
                            - Iterating a list, set
                            - Iterating a map
                            - Understand ConcurrentModificationException

6. Keywords                 - final, static, super, private, public, protected, throw, throws, this
7. Program with String      - split, concat, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, index

## Data structure & Algorithm

1. ADT                      - List, Set, map 	
                            - Adding elements, Iterator, removing elements, ConcurrentModificationException
2. Big O Notation			      - O(1), O(n), O(n2), O(log(n))
3. Sorting Algorithms 		  - Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
							              - How to perform Arrays.sort() & Collections.sort()
4. Searching Algorithms		  - Linear & Biary Search
5. Recursive				        - Printing Fibonnaci Series
